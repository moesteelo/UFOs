# UFOs
# **Overview of Project**

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a comprehensive and dynamic UFOs webpage and table data using two main programming languages for this project, JavaScript, and HTML. This will allow users to have multiple search features that will provide data regarding UFOs sighting and in-depth details of their occurrence.

## **Results**

By providing users with multiple search filters allows for an easier access to search data regarding UFO sightings. With a filtered table users can enter any data within the filtered table regarding city, state, country, shape, and comments. Users can search for a specific sighting or even a general broad overview of UFO sightings in state or country.

## **Summary**

***Drawbacks:***

* One drawback of this design is that the data is relatively a decade year old. While the table filters help make searching for UFO data relatively easy and simple, users might not have the latest update regarding UFO sightings.

***Recommendations:***
* The first recommendation that I would add is by further developing a webpage link that would scrap the newest UFO sightings with mongodb collecting the up-to-date data for users search preference.
* The second recommendation is to make the webpage more dynamic in terms of UFO animations to attract the users attention, as well as when users input a shape in the filter table animations representing those shapes come up. This will allow users to compare shape sighting they have seen to what the data shape animates.
